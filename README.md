### Team Members
- Team Lead: Mevin Benty - Sahrdaya college of engineering and technology

### Project Description
A Tinder-style app for Kerala cuisine where users can swipe right on dishes they love and left on ones they'll pass. Features witty Malayalam responses, interactive animations, and unique personalities for each dish - from the dramatic Porotta to the judgmental Unniyappam!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Finding your perfect food match in Kerala is harder than finding your soulmate! Are you tired of committing to a plate of Puttu only to realize you were meant to be with Porotta? Our app solves the age-old dilemma of food indecision with style and humor, helping you find your true food love through the power of swiping!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing Bakshana Tinder - where every swipe brings you closer to your true food love! Our revolutionary app lets you:
- Swipe right on dishes that make your heart (and stomach) flutter
- Swipe left on the ones that don't spark joy
- Super-like those special dishes that deserve extra love
- Get roasted in Malayalam when rejected
- Experience the joy of matching with your favorite foods
- All while being judged by sentient Kerala dishes with attitudes!
